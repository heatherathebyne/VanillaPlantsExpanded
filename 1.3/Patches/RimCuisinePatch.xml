						<description>An herb-like vegetable widely cultivated for humans and livestock alike. Though these look like ordinary beets from the outside, on the inside they have distinct red-and-white-striped flesh. These are highest on the sweetness scale. While beets do require rich soil they are quite hearty, and will continue to grow very slowly through winter. They need to be planted during growing season, though.</description>

						<description>These spongy fruits are technically berries - but, use them like a berry, and you'll have a bad time. Instead, they're used similarly to vegetables. Grown in temperate and tropical climates. The tiny fairy tale variety has purple and white stripes and is no bigger than the palm of your hand. They can be prepared in the same way as larger eggplants, but take especially well to grilling since theyâ€™re so tender.</description>
